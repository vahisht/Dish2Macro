This is an unlocked version of the Dishonored freescroll macro, originally made by [Som1se](https://github.com/Som1Lse). All credit goes to them.

To use:
 1. Download the macro, containing the .exe and .ini files.
 2. Bind the action you want to mousewheel up/down ingame .
 2. Modify the .ini file to specify which key will trigger your macro.
 3. Run the program.
 
# Dish2Macro.ini
If you don't like using `space` you can change it in `Dish2Macro.ini` to a different key.

You can also spam `wheel up` instead, or set up separate keys for each scroll wheel direction.

See that file for an information on how to configure the macro.

# Is this allowed in speedruns?
Usually needs to be explicitly allowed by the moderators of the game. If you're not sure, ask! 
Also please check whether the game you're running has a limit on how many times a macro can fire the action per second. This can be modified in the .ini file.
