This is an unlocked version of a freescroll macro, originally made by [Som1se](https://github.com/Som1Lse). 

To use:
 1. Run the program.
 2. Bind `wheel down` to jump in game. (You can still keep the default spacebar bind.)
 3. Hold `space`.

# Dish2Macro.ini
If you don't like using `space` you can change it in `Dish2Macro.ini` to a different key.

You can also spam `wheel up` instead, or set up separate keys for each scroll wheel direction.

See that file for an information on how to configure the macro.

# Is this allowed in speedruns?
Yes.

Specifically any of the Dishonored games allow it.
